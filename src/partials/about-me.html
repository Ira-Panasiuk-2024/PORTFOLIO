        I'm Ira, and my journey into the world of web development began with a
        simple curiosity: how are the websites we use every day created? This
        curiosity grew into a real passion. After completing intensive courses
        in full-stack development, I realized that this is exactly what I want
        to do. I am fascinated by the whole process: from the first idea to the
        finished product that users can see and feel.

        What inspires me?

      <p class="about-text" data-lang-key="about_me.inspiration_text">
        The opportunity to combine creativity with technology. Every project is
        a new challenge, a new opportunity to learn something interesting and
        create something useful. As a full-stack developer, I understand the
        importance of every detail - from page loading speed to intuitive
        interface. I strive to create not just websites, but digital experiences
        that are memorable.
